# receiverLibrary
v.1.0

This library is intended for use in a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to handle digital signals from a 433mhz radio module. 

I created this library because, after some research, I couldn't find any other existing radio library that worked for Micropython (Raspberry Pi Pico's coding language). Therefore, I decided to make my own library. 

More updates and instructions on how to use the library coming soon...
